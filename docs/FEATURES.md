# Features

This is a main overview over the planned features in the Web API HTML-view
browser.

## List all API endpoints

The DHIS API is large and pretty hard to follow at times. Our application will
provide a simple list of all API endpoints, so that you will have the overview
you've always wanted.

## Searchable list of API endpoints

A typical API-user will be searching for a specific endpoint of functionality.
Our application will accommodate such users by adding a simple search
functionality.

## Show information about an endpoint

Once you've found the endpoint you need, you might want to know how it works.
The Web API HTML-view browser lets you discover each and every aspect about each
endpoint through an informative view.

## Show example responses of an endpoint

An example response is very helpful when developing against an API. Our
application will provide you with such a response, both in XML and JSON format.

## Experiment with the API

Getting to know an API is easier if you have a sample client to experiment with.
This application will let the user add their own input parameters, choose the
HTTP verb and lots of other fun things.

## And more!

We will continue to fill out this list throughout the course of this project.
Perhaps we'll come up with something completely ground breaking? Only time will
tell.
